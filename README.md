# Python_Projects
This is a Python script that creates a class called "DatabaseManage" which is used to interact with a SQLite database named "courses.db". The class contains methods for inserting data into the database, fetching data from the database, and deleting data from the database. The script also provides a user interface where users can input a choice to either insert a new course, show all courses, or delete a course. Depending on the user's choice, the appropriate method is called to perform the action. The script uses the SQLite library to connect to the database and execute SQL commands.
